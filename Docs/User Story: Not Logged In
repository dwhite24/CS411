Non-logged in user: I am always very indecisive about choosing songs to listen to/movies to watch and need something to pick the right songs/movies based on the mood of the day depending on the weather outside. However, I donâ€™t need something complex that requires registration or a subscription and would like a service that allows me to quickly and easily choose a song/movie for me. Saving the results is not a priority for me since I will not go back to listen/watch the same things anyways.
