Register user:
If the user has not previously signed up for our site and would like to register. Then they can choose the registration option from the login page. On the registration page they must enter their first and last name, their email address, username, and password. They can additionally input additional information, such as their age, hometown, or date of birth. The system will check if their email address and username are unique and if it is will allow them to sign up and store all of the information into the database. If the email address and username are not unique the system will inform the user which is not unique and prompt them to try again with a different username or email address. After signing up the site will prompt them for any genre of music or movies which interest them and store those in the database along with the other information. Alternatively they can use OAuth to login through a third party app and then will just prompt for the genres of music or movies which interest them.
