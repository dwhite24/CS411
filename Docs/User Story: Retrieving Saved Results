Retrieving saved results:

If the user is logged in and would like to retrieve their saved results:
I have used the application before and would like to view past songs/movies that the application has chosen for me. I would log back into my account and click on a tab that pulls up a list of the saved results. I have the option to delete any of those results. I also have the option to click on those results to open them up on any streaming platforms.
