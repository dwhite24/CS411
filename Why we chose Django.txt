Our team got together to discuss how we were going to develop our application. In order to develop it, we decided to use Django since that is the framework which our group has the most experience with. In addition, we also decided to choose django since it is commonly used to develop web applications. Therefore, there would be lots of documentation online and resources available to us whenever we need it.
