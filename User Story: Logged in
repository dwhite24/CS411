Primary-user: As a logged-in user, I want to be able to browse for music/movies so that they fit the mood of the weather outside. Iâ€™d log in/register and my location will be taken. Based on the weather, a set of movies/music will be returned to me. I have the option to save these results to a list. I can also access said list and see previously saved results and have the option to remove any results from the list. I also have the option to edit profile information.
