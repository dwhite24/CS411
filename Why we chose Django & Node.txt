Our team got together to discuss how we were going to develop our application. In order to develop it, we decided to use Django and Node since those are the two technologies which our group has the most experience with. In addition, we also decided to choose these two technologies since they are commonly used to develop web applications. Therefore, there would be lots of documentation online and resources available to us whenever we need it.
