User 1 = Guest, wants to generate results (won't be saved)

The app starts with the prompt to make a new user account, but alternatively allows the user to continue without logging in. 

Once the user clicks on generate results as a guest, the user inputs zip code and genre of music. The service returns the results and the user is prompted to sign in to save results. 

Failures:

If a network error occurs, the user has to go return to the homepage and reinput their zipcode and genre.

If there is some other kind of error (database, or others), the incident gets reported to the administrator and the user gets a "We'll be back" page.

Success:

If all goes right, the user gets the recommendation and we're all happy.

User 2 = Logged in, wants to retrieve saved results

The app starts with the prompt to make a new user account, and the user clicks on the log in button below.

The user logs in.

Failures:

Account doesn't exist: Creates a new user account with the given account.

Password mismatch: Might not have this problem since we're doing third party only

Fields contain malicious code: Bans user's IP for one week

Success:

User gets the results, and has the option to click a link and go on Spotify to start listening. User logs out.
